#react-datepicker-masked

DEMO (only for a timepicker mode, date excluded): https://datepicker-test-zujefutmkx.now.sh/

- a static react prototype project
- created with the amazing CRA on typescript, hosted with Zeit's now.sh
- testing the react-datepicker component to have it interop with Inputmask vanilla js plugin for masking inputs so I can enable keyboard typing for reading input values besides clicking on the datetime picker dialog
